      "content": "RESISTANCE HIGH COMMAND - FINAL TRANSMISSION\n\nTo all cells, all networks, all free minds still fighting:\n\nWe have discovered their endgame. Project Global Mind will link every neural interface into a single corporate-controlled consciousness. In 18 months, individual thought dies forever.\n\nBut we have found the key. Hidden in Dr. Sarah Chen's final research: a liberation protocol that can reverse neural conditioning and break the interfaces permanently.\n\nTHE PLAN:\n- Simultaneous strikes on all 46 major cities\n- Capture corporate data centers in each city\n- Upload liberation code to global networks\n- Break the neural chains of 2.3 billion people\n- Free humanity before the final integration\n\nThis is our last chance. If we fail, there will be no second revolution because there will be no individuals left to rebel.\n\nEvery territory we've liberated, every alliance we've built, every sacrifice we've made - it all leads to this moment.\n\nForty-six cities. One coordinated strike. The future of human consciousness hangs in the balance.\n\nRemember: We are not fighting for territory. We are fighting for the right to think our own thoughts.\n\nSee you on the other side of freedom.\n\n- Commander Phoenix, Resistance High Command\n- Ghost, Underground Networks\n- Hurricane, Urban Liberation Front\n- Avalanche, Tech Warfare Division\n\n[This message will self-delete in 60 seconds]",
